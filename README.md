<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Rewriting code is tedious, meaningless and boring. To counter act this horror we collect our best code snippets in this repo to be used in other projects. Projects created with the bord4 analysis cookiecutter can pull directly from this repo.

### Requirements

---

- pyenv - manage python versions
- pipenv - manage python dependencies

To install on mac you can use homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade
brew install pyenv
brew install pipenv
```

## Usage

To play around with the templates and code in src you must first install the virtual enviroment.

```bash
pipenv install
```

And the run jupyter lab

```bash
pipenv run jupyter lab
```

## Contributing

Do you have write permissions to the repo? Then you can clone this project to a folder on your computer.

```bash
git clone this.template-repo
```

If not do the following:

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.

This will clone the repo into `bord4-analysis-templates`. 

Create a branch for your changes

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-branch
```

Make your changes, rememeber to commit. And always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.

If you're working on a clone push the branch to github and make PR.

If your're working a fork:

- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- …
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
  your extra branch(es).
